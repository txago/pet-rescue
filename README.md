#petrescue

This project was build from the OmniStack Week 11, a challenge created by brazilian bootcamp [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat), in which we create a web and mobile app using **Node.js, React.js and React Native**.

## The project

**petrescue** is a platform that was created with the aim of bringing rescuers and people interested in adopting pets together. It's customized version from the OmniStack platform, since their solution was focused on NGOs.

## The challenge

I started developing the back-end with **Node.js and Express**, created the database, routes and tested them with Postman. Following, I designed a new UI and built the front-end with **React.js**, creating the pages and components with React Bootstrap, so that I could have a responsive website faster (differently from the class). The third day was used to build the mobile application, using **React Native and Expo**, so that I could emulate the app with any smartphone while using the database. Finally, I added some validations, and wrote unit and integration tests with **Jest** for the back-end.
